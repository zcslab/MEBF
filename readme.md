MEBF, a geometric segmentation inspired Boolean matrix factorization

## Description
You can find the R code for MEBF in MEBF.R.
MEBF requires one parameters, thres,in the spreading process. User could also specify the Dim(number of patterns), P(percentage of covered 1s) as convergence criteria.  
We also provide an analysis of head and neck cancer scRNAseq data to illustrate the applications of MEBF in high dimensional data. It requires Rtsne package to visualize in 2 dimensions.

The paper was accepted by **AAAI 2020**.
